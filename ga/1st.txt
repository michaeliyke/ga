When I heard Fred's quote, it immediately rang a bell to me. It sounds familiar but with better context and intensity. 

I have known for a while now that to be successful in tech requires more than just motivations. Yes! It requires a finality on the decision to be successful, even when the passions wane and all you have left is your why.

Last month being April, I paused to ask myself some home questions about whether or not a software career was for me, real! And if you are wondering why, I have been in the tech space for a while now without much success. And so, that time came that I had to reconsider things. I asked why I haven't hit the marks yet despite all my efforts. 

From what hiring managers told me last April, I already knew the answer. I needed to focus more on filling my gaps. Yet here I was, exactly a year later without much to show for the run! It was discouraging. But after considering my main reason for setting out in the first place and my recent moves, I dared to dream again! Then I drew the maps again, and set new deadlines.
